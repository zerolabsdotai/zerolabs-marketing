# EPIC-218 / ZER-223 Closeout

## Scope confirmation (ZER-223 documentation only)
This closeout confirms ZER-223 is documentation-only. No code changes, CMS schema changes, homepage edits, or deployment changes are included in scope.

## Ownership boundaries
- Marketing owns content edits within the CMS for the homepage document.
- Engineering owns CMS schemas, build configuration, and site code.
- Product app ownership remains separate and is not impacted by EPIC-218.

## What requires engineering involvement
- Any CMS schema or content model changes.
- New section types or homepage layout changes.
- Changes to build pipelines, previews, or deployment settings.
- Any request that introduces backend logic, auth, API routes, or environment variables.
