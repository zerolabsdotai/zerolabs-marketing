We keep seeing the same pattern: impressive AI demos that fall apart when they meet real systems. The gap is not model quality. It's operations.

## The execution gap

Teams can build a prototype in days, but production asks different questions:

- What can run, and who approved it?
- How much does it cost, and who owns the budget?
- What happened when things went wrong?

Without answers, the safest move is to keep AI out of critical paths.

## Operators need controls

Real operators need guardrails, clear limits, and the ability to replay what happened. That means:

- Safe, constrained execution for tools and agents.
- Cost control through quotas and budgets.
- Observability that matches the stakes.

## What ZeroFlow is

ZeroFlow is our answer to that operational gap. It is a layer that makes AI execution safer, more observable, and more predictable for teams that run real systems.

## Why now

The tooling has moved fast, but operational practice has not. We are building ZeroFlow to make repeatable, responsible execution the default.
