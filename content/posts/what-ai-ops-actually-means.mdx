AI Ops is not a buzzword for more dashboards. It is the discipline of running AI systems like any other critical infrastructure.

## A practical definition

AI Ops means building the controls that make AI execution predictable:

- Guardrails that limit tools, inputs, and outputs.
- Quotas and budgets that keep cost and risk bounded.
- Observability that explains actions and decisions.
- Repeatable execution with versioned behavior.

## What it is not

AI Ops is not another experiment tracker, and it is not a set of one-off scripts. It is a repeatable way to ship AI features without surprises.

## Why it matters

When teams skip these basics, they ship uncertainty into production. When they get them right, they can move faster with confidence.
